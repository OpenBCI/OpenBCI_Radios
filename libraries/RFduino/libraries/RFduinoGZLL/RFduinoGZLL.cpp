/*
The Gazell protocol is a wireless communication protocol that is used
to setup a robust wireless link between a single host and up to eight
devices in a star network topology.

The Host in a Gazell network is always listening, and it is the Device
that always initiates a communication.

Each packet that a Device sends is required to be acknowledged by the
Host.  Gazell auotmatically handle packet retransmission if necessary.

It is possible for the Host to send data to the Device by piggybacking
data to an acknowledgement (ACK) packet.  Therefore a Host has to wait
for a packet from a Device before it can send any data to it.

Gazell utilizes channel hopping functionality that gives a high date
rate and reliable wireless link.

Gazell requires no connection packets to setup a link, and devices can
enter and exit from the network at any time.
