  - Cleaned up SPI library

v 1.8
  - iBeacon Enhancement

v 1.7.2
  - Enhancement to PPI channel selection to eliminate potential conflicts
  - Added the ability to select I2C speed to Wire Library (100, 250 or 400 kbps)

v 1.7.1

    sketches for use.  More documentation is also available in
    cores/arduino/Memory.h
  - Added a ProximityMovingAverage sketch for investigating RSSI to distance
    calculations
  - Fix for iOS SDK 7.0 issue with the disconnect characteristic

v 1.4
