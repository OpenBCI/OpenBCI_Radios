# OpenBCI Node.js SDK

A Node.js module for OpenBCI ~ written with love by [Push The World!](http://www.pushtheworldllc.com)

We are proud to support all functionality of the OpenBCI 8 and 16 Channel boards and are actively developing and maintaining this module.

The purpose of this module is to **get connected** and **start streaming** as fast as possible.

## TL;DR

#### Install via npm:

```
npm install openbci
```

#### Get connected and start streaming

```js
var OpenBCIBoard = require('openbci').OpenBCIBoard;
var ourBoard = new OpenBCIBoard();
ourBoard.connect(portName)
    .then(function() {
        ourBoard.on('ready',function() {
            ourBoard.streamStart();
            ourBoard.on('sample',function(sample) {
                /** Work with sample */
                for (var i = 0; i < ourBoard.numberOfChannels(); i++) {
                    console.log("Channel " + (i + 1) + ": " + sample.channelData[i].toFixed(8) + " Volts.");
                    // prints to the console
                    //  "Channel 1: 0.00001987 Volts."
                    //  "Channel 2: 0.00002255 Volts."
                    //  ...
                    //  "Channel 8: -0.00001875 Volts."
                }
            });
        });
})
```

## General Overview

Initialization
--------------

Initializing the board:

```js
var OpenBCIBoard = require('openbci');
var ourBoard = new OpenBCIBoard.OpenBCIBoard();
```

For initializing with options, such as verbose print outs:

```js
var OpenBCIBoard = require('openbci').OpenBCIBoard;
var ourBoard = new OpenBCIBoard({
    verbose: true
});
```

Or if you don't have a board and want to use synthetic data:

```js
var OpenBCIBoard = require('openbci').OpenBCIBoard;
var ourBoard = new OpenBCIBoard({
    simulate: true
});
```

Another useful way to start the simulator:
```js
var openBCIBoard = require('openbci');
var k = openBCIBoard.OpenBCIConstants;
var ourBoard = openBCIBoard.OpenBCIBoard();
ourBoard.connect(k.OBCISimulatorPortName) // This will set `simulate` to true
    .then(function(boardSerial) {
        ourBoard.on('ready',function() {
            /** Start streaming, reading registers, what ever your heart desires  */
        });
    }).catch(function(err) {
        /** Handle connection errors */
    });
```


'ready' event
------------

You MUST wait for the 'ready' event to be emitted before streaming/talking with the board. The ready happens asynchronously
so installing the 'sample' listener and writing before the ready event might result in... nothing at all.

```js
var OpenBCIBoard = require('openbci').OpenBCIBoard;
var ourBoard = new OpenBCIBoard();
ourBoard.connect(portName).then(function(boardSerial) {
    ourBoard.on('ready',function() {
        /** Start streaming, reading registers, what ever your heart desires  */
    });
}).catch(function(err) {
    /** Handle connection errors */
});            
```

Sample properties:
------------------
* `startByte` (`Number` should be `0xA0`)
* `sampleNumber` (a `Number` between 0-255)
* `channelData` (channel data indexed at 0 filled with floating point `Numbers` in Volts)
* `accelData` (`Array` with X, Y, Z accelerometer values when new data available)
* `auxData` (`Buffer` filled with either 2 bytes (if time synced) or 6 bytes (not time synced))
* `stopByte` (`Number` should be `0xCx` where x is 0-15 in hex)
* `boardTime` (`Number` the raw board time)
* `timeStamp` (`Number` the `boardTime` plus the NTP calculated offset)

The power of this module is in using the sample emitter, to be provided with samples to do with as you wish.

You can also start the simulator by sending `.connect(portName)` with `portName` equal to `'OpenBCISimulator'`.

To get a 'sample' event, you need to:
-------------------------------------
1. Call `.connect(serialPortName)`
2. Install the 'ready' event emitter on resolved promise
3. In callback for 'ready' emitter, call `streamStart()`
4. Install the 'sample' event emitter
```js
var OpenBCIBoard = require('openbci').OpenBCIBoard;
var ourBoard = new OpenBCIBoard();
ourBoard.connect(portName).then(function() {
    ourBoard.on('ready',function() {
        ourBoard.streamStart();
        ourBoard.on('sample',function(sample) {
            /** Work with sample */
        });
    });
}).catch(function(err) {
    /** Handle connection errors */
});            
```
Close the connection with `.streamStop()` and disconnect with `.disconnect()`
```js
var ourBoard = new require('openbci').OpenBCIBoard();
ourBoard.streamStop().then(ourBoard.disconnect());
```

Time Syncing
------------
You must be using OpenBCI firmware version 2 in order to do time syncing. After you `.connect()` and send a `.softReset()`, you can call `.usingVersionTwoFirmware()` to get a boolean response as to if you are using `v1` or `v2`.

Now using firmware `v2`, the fun begins! What we set out to do was synchronize not only the board to this modules clock, but also with a global NTP server, so that you could use several different devices and all sync to the same global server. That way you can really do some serious cloud computing!

```js
var OpenBCIBoard = require('openbci').OpenBCIBoard,
    ourBoard = new OpenBCIBoard({
        verbose:true,
        timeSync: true // Sync up with NTP servers in constructor
    });

// Call to connect
ourBoard.connect(portName).then(() => {
    ourBoard.on('ready',() => {
        ourBoard.streamStart()
            .catch(err => {
                console.log(`stream start: ${err}`);
            })
    });
    // 'synced' event contains the guts of the whole sync operation.
    ourBoard.on('synced',obj => {
        console.log('sync obj',obj);
    });
    ourBoard.on('sample',sample => {
        // Resynchronize every 100 samples
        if (sample.sampleNumber % 100 === 0) {
            ourBoard.syncClocks();
        }

        if (sample.timeStamp) { // true after the first sync
            console.log(`NTP Time Stamp ${sample.timeStamp}`);
        }

    });
})
.catch(err => {
    console.log(`connect: ${err}`);
});
```

Auto-finding boards
-------------------
You must have the OpenBCI board connected to the PC before trying to automatically find it.

If a port is not automatically found, then call `.listPorts()` to get a list of all serial ports this would be a good place to present a drop down picker list to the user, so they may manually select the serial port name.

```js
var OpenBCIBoard = require('openbci').OpenBCIBoard;
var ourBoard = new OpenBCIBoard();
ourBoard.autoFindOpenBCIBoard().then(portName => {
    if(portName) {
        /**
        * Connect to the board with portName
        * i.e. ourBoard.connect(portName).....
        */
    } else {
        /**Unable to auto find OpenBCI board*/
    }
});
```

Note: `.autoFindOpenBCIBoard()` will return the name of the Simulator if you instantiate with option `simulate: true`.

Auto Test - (Using impedance to determine signal quality)
---------------------------------------------------------
Measuring impedance is a vital tool in ensuring great data is collected.

**_IMPORTANT!_** Measuring impedance takes time, so *only test what you must*

Your OpenBCI board will have electrodes hooked up to either a P input, N input or in some cases both inputs.

To test specific inputs of channels:

1. Connect to board.
2. Start streaming.
3. Install the 'impedanceArray' emitter
4. Call `.impedanceTestChannels()` with your configuration array

A configuration array looks like, for an 8 channel board, `['-','N','n','p','P','-','b','b']`

Where there are the same number of elements as channels and each element can be either:

* `p` or `P` (only test P input)
* `n` or `N` (only test N input)
* `b` or `B` (test both inputs) (takes 66% longer to run then previous two `p` or `n`)
* `-` (ignore channel)

Without further ado, here is an example:
```js
var OpenBCIBoard = require('openbci').OpenBCIBoard;
var ourBoard = new OpenBCIBoard();
ourBoard.connect(portName).then(function(boardSerial) {
    ourBoard.on('ready',function() {
        ourBoard.streamStart();
        ourBoard.once('impedanceArray', impedanceArray => {
            /** Work with impedance Array */
        });
        ourBoard.impedanceTestChannels(['n','N','n','p','P','p','b','B']).catch(err => console.log(err));
    });
}).catch(function(err) {
    /** Handle connection errors */
});
```

But wait! What is this `impedanceArray`? An Array of Objects, for each object:
```js
[{
    channel: 1,
    P: {
        raw: -1,
        text: 'init'
    },
    N: {
        raw: -1,
        text: 'init'
    }
},
{
    // Continues for each channel up to the amount of channels on board (8 or 16)
},...];
```

Where:

* *channel* is the channel number (`impedanceArray[0]` is channel 1, `impedanceArray[6]` is channel 7)
* *P* is the P input data (Note: P is capitalized)
  * *raw* is an impedance value resulting from the Goertzel algorithm.
  * *text* is a text interpretation of the `average`
    * **Good** impedance is < 5k Ohms
    * **Ok** impedance is 5 to 10k Ohms
    * **Bad** impedance is > 10k Ohms
    * **None** impedance is > 1M Ohms
* *N* is the N input data (Note: N is capitalized) (see above for what N object consists of)

To run an impedance test on all inputs, one channel at a time:

1. Connect to board
2. Start streaming
3. Install the 'impedanceObject'
4. Call `.impedanceTestAllChannels()`

**Note: Takes up to 5 seconds to start measuring impedances. There is an unknown number of samples taken. Not always 60!**

For example:

```js
var OpenBCIBoard = require('openbci').OpenBCIBoard;
var ourBoard = new OpenBCIBoard();
ourBoard.connect(portName).then(function(boardSerial) {
    ourBoard.streamStart();
    ourBoard.on('impedanceArray', impedanceArray => {
        /** Work with impedance */
    });
    ourBoard.impedanceTestAllChannels();
}
```

See Reference Guide for a complete list of impedance tests.

## Methods

### OpenBCIBoard (options)

Create new instance of an OpenBCI board.

**_options (optional)_**

Board optional configurations.

* `baudRate` {Number} - Baud Rate, defaults to 115200. Manipulating this is allowed if firmware on board has been previously configured.
* `boardType` {String} - Specifies type of OpenBCI board (3 possible boards)
  * `default` - 8 Channel OpenBCI board (Default)
  * `daisy` - 8 Channel board with Daisy Module - 16 Channels
  * `ganglion` - 4 Channel board
    (NOTE: THIS IS IN-OP TIL RELEASE OF GANGLION BOARD 08/2016)
* `simulate` {Boolean} - Full functionality, just mock data. Must attach Daisy module by setting `simulatorDaisyModuleAttached` to `true` in order to get 16 channels. (Default `false`)
* `simulatorBoardFailure` {Boolean} - Simulates board communications failure. This occurs when the RFduino on the board is not polling the RFduino on the dongle. (Default `false`)
* `simulatorDaisyModuleAttached` {Boolean} - Simulates a daisy module being attached to the OpenBCI board. This is useful if you want to test how your application reacts to a user requesting 16 channels but there is no daisy module actually attached, or vice versa, where there is a daisy module attached and the user only wants to use 8 channels. (Default `false`)
* `simulatorFirmwareVersion` {String} - Allows the simulator to use firmware version 2 features. (2 Possible Options)
  * `v1` - Firmware Version 1 (Default)
  * `v2` - Firmware Version 2
* `simulatorHasAccelerometer` - {Boolean} - Sets simulator to send packets with accelerometer data. (Default `true`)
* `simulatorInjectAlpha` - {Boolean} - Inject a 10Hz alpha wave in Channels 1 and 2 (Default `true`)
* `simulatorInjectLineNoise` {String} - Injects line noise on channels. (3 Possible Options)
  * `60Hz` - 60Hz line noise (Default) [America]
  * `50Hz` - 50Hz line noise [Europe]
  * `None` - Do not inject line noise.
* `simulatorSampleRate` {Number} - The sample rate to use for the simulator. Simulator will set to 125 if `simulatorDaisyModuleAttached` is set `true`. However, setting this option overrides that setting and this sample rate will be used. (Default is `250`)
* `simulatorSerialPortFailure` {Boolean} - Simulates not being able to open a serial connection. Most likely due to a OpenBCI dongle not being plugged in.
* `sntpTimeSync` - {Boolean} Syncs the module up with an SNTP time server and uses that as single source of truth instead of local computer time. (Default `true`)
* `verbose` {Boolean} - Print out useful debugging events

**Note, we have added support for either all lowercase OR camel case for the options, use whichever style you prefer.**

### .autoFindOpenBCIBoard()

Automatically find an OpenBCI board.

**Note: This will always return an Array of `COM` ports on Windows**

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled with a `portName` such as `/dev/tty.*` on Mac/Linux or `OpenBCISimulator` if `this.options.simulate === true`.

### .channelOff(channelNumber)

Turn off a specified channel

**_channelNumber_**

A number (1-16) specifying which channel you want to turn off.

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled if the command was sent to the write queue.

### .channelOn(channelNumber)

Turn on a specified channel

**_channelNumber_**

A number (1-16) specifying which channel you want to turn on.

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled if the command was sent to the write queue.

### .channelSet(channelNumber,powerDown,gain,inputType,bias,srb2,srb1)

Send a channel setting command to the board.

**_channelNumber_**  

Determines which channel to set. It's a 'Number' (1-16)

**_powerDown_**

Powers the channel up or down. It's a 'Bool' where `true` turns the channel off and `false` turns the channel on (default)

**_gain_**

Sets the gain for the channel. It's a 'Number' that is either (1,2,4,6,8,12,24(default))

**_inputType_**

Selects the ADC channel input source. It's a 'String' that **MUST** be one of the following: "normal", "shorted", "biasMethod" , "mvdd" , "temp" , "testsig", "biasDrp", "biasDrn".

**_bias_**

Selects if the channel shall include the channel input in bias generation. It's a 'Bool' where `true` includes the channel in bias (default) or `false` it removes it from bias.

**_srb2_**

Select to connect (`true`) this channel's P input to the SRB2 pin. This closes a switch between P input and SRB2 for the given channel, and allows the P input to also remain connected to the ADC. It's a 'Bool' where `true` connects this input to SRB2 (default) or `false` which disconnect this input from SRB2.

**_srb1_**

Select to connect (`true`) all channels' N inputs to SRB1. This effects all pins, and disconnects all N inputs from the ADC. It's a 'Bool' where `true` connects all N inputs to SRB1 and `false` disconnects all N inputs from SRB1 (default).

**_Returns_** a promise fulfilled if proper commands sent to the write queue, rejects on bad input or no board.

**Example**
```js
ourBoard.channelSet(2,false,24,'normal',true,true,false);
// sends ['x','2','0','6','0','1','1','0','X'] to the command queue
```

### .connect (portName)

The essential precursor method to be called initially to establish a serial connection to the OpenBCI board.

**_portName_**

A number specifying which channel you want to get data on. Only 1-8 at this time.

**Note, at this time this does not work for the daisy board**

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled if the command was sent to the board and the `.processBytes()` function is ready to reach for the specified channel.

### .impedanceTestAllChannels()

To apply test signals to the channels on the OpenBCI board used to test for impedance. This can take a little while to actually run (<8 seconds)!

Don't forget to install the `impedanceArray` emitter to receive the impendances!

Get the current number of channels available to use. (i.e. 8 or 16).

**Note: This is dependent on if you configured the board correctly on setup options. Specifically as a daisy.**

**_Returns_** a number, the total number of available channels.

### .printBytesIn()

Prints the total number of bytes that were read in this session to the console.

### .printPacketsBad()

Prints the total number of packets that were not able to be read in this session to the console.

### .printPacketsRead()

Prints the total number of packets that were read in this session to the console.

### .printRegisterSettings()

Prints all register settings for the ADS1299 and the LIS3DH on the OpenBCI board.

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled if the command was sent to the write queue.

### .radioBaudRateSet(speed)

Used to set the OpenBCI Host (Dongle) baud rate. With the RFduino configuration, the Dongle is the Host and the Board is the Device. Only the Device can initiate a communication between the two entities. There exists a detrimental error where if the Host is interrupted by the radio during a Serial write, then all hell breaks loose. So this is an effort to eliminate that problem by increasing the rate at which serial data is sent from the Host to the Serial driver. The rate can either be set to default or fast. Further the function should reject if currently streaming. Lastly and more important, if the board is not running the new firmware then this functionality does not exist and thus this method will reject. If the board is using firmware 2+ then this function should resolve the new baud rate after closing the current serial port and reopening one.

**Note, this functionality requires OpenBCI Firmware Version 2.0**

**_speed_**

{String} - The baud rate that to switch to. Can be either `default` (115200) or `fast` (230400).

**_Returns_** {Promise} - Resolves a {Number} that is the new baud rate, rejects on error.

### .radioChannelGet()

### .radioPollTimeSet(pollTime)

Used to set the OpenBCI poll time. With the RFduino configuration, the Dongle is the Host and the Board is the Device. Only the Device can initiate a communication between the two entities. Therefore this sets the interval at which the Device polls the Host for new information. Further the function should reject if currently streaming. Lastly and more important, if the board is not running the new firmware then this functionality does not exist and thus this method will reject. If the board is using firmware 2+ then this function should resolve.

**Note, this functionality requires OpenBCI Firmware Version 2.0**

 * `1hour` - 1 hour
 * `2hour` - 2 hour
 * `4hour` - 4 hour
 * `12hour` - 12 hour
 * `24hour` - 24 hour

**Note: You must have the proper type of SD card inserted into the board for logging to work.**

**_Returns_** resolves if the command was added to the write queue.

### .sdStop()

Stop logging to the SD card and close any open file. If you are not streaming when you send this command, then you should expect to get a success or failure message followed by and end of transmission `$$$`. The success message contains a lot of useful information about what happened when writing to the SD card.

**_Returns_** resolves if the command was added to the write queue.

### .simulatorEnable()

To enter simulate mode. Must call `.connect()` after.

**Note, must be called after the constructor.**

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled if able to enter simulate mode, reject if not.

### .simulatorDisable()

**Note, You must have called and fulfilled `.connect()` AND observed a `'ready'` emitter before calling this method.**

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled if the command was sent to the write queue, rejected if unable.

### .streamStop()

Sends a stop streaming command to the board.

**Note, You must have called and fulfilled `.connect()` AND observed a `'ready'` emitter before calling this method.**

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled if the command was sent to the write queue, rejected if unable.

### .syncClocks()

Send the command to tell the board to start the syncing protocol. Must be connected, streaming and using version +2 firmware.

 * `none` - Reset to default

**_Returns_** a promise, if the commands were sent to write buffer.

### .time()

Uses `._sntpNow()` time when sntpTimeSync specified in options, or else use Date.now() for time.

**_Returns_** time since UNIX epoch in ms.

### .usingVersionTwoFirmware()

Convenience method to determine if you can use firmware v2.x.x capabilities.

**Note, should be called after a `.softReset()` because we can parse the output of that to determine if we are using firmware version 2.**

**_Returns_** a boolean, true if using firmware version 2 or greater.

### .write(dataToWrite)

Send commands to the board. Due to the OpenBCI board firmware 1.0, a 10ms spacing **must** be observed between every command sent to the board. This method handles the timing and spacing between characters by adding characters to a global write queue and pulling from it every 10ms. If you are using firmware version +2.0 then you no spacing will be used.

**_dataToWrite_**

Either a single character or an Array of characters

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled if the board has been connected and `dataToWrite` has been added to the write queue, rejected if there were any problems.

**Example**

Sends a single character command to the board.
```js
// ourBoard has fulfilled the promise on .connected() and 'ready' has been observed previously
ourBoard.write('a');
```

Sends an array of bytes
```js
// ourBoard has fulfilled the promise on .connected() and 'ready' has been observed previously
ourBoard.write(['x','0','1','0','0','0','0','0','0','X']);
```

Taking full advantage of the write queue. The following would be sent at t = 0, 10ms, 20ms, 30ms
```js
ourBoard.write('t');
ourBoard.write('a');
ourBoard.write('c');
ourBoard.write('o');
```
