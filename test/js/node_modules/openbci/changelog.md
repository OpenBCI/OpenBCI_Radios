# 1.1.0

### New Features

* Add time sync tutorial in `README.md`
* Add function `.time()` which should be used in time syncing
* Synced object can be emitted on `synced` event. Check `valid` property for if the sync was done.

### Breaking Changes

* Changed option named `timeSync` to `sntpTimeSync`
* Removed function called `.sntpNow()` because it was replaced by `.time()`

### Bug Fixes

* Time sync improvements

# 1.0.1

### New Features

* Add time sync tutorial in `README.md`

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed bug in simulator that lead to samples being all zeros.
* Fixed time sync sent confirmation bug that led to bad time values.

# 1.0.0

The second major release for the OpenBCI Node.js SDK brings major changes, improvements and stability, on top of a push to increase automated test coverage.

### New Features

* NPM Module now called `openbci` instead of `openbci-sdk`
* Firmware version 2.0 support.
* Clock synchronization between OpenBCI board and this driver
* `.info` property which contains verified board information parsed from the OpenBCI's `softReset()` response.
* `eot` event that is emitted when a user sends a command that results in an EOT ("$$$") being sent from the board
* Daisy (16 channel) support
* Simulator overhaul, it completely mocks the board. Can now simulate board failure, where the board stops talking to the dongle. Can also mock a serial port failure.
* `error` and `close` events from serialport now emtted events users can subscribe to.

### Breaking Changes

* NPM package is not called `openbci-sdk` anymore, now called `openbci`
* Accelerometer data now goes into `.accelData` array instead of `.auxData` array.
* In openBCISample.js
  * `parseRawPacket()` is now called `parseRawPacketStandard()`
* `ready` event only triggered after soft reset. `eot` event emitted in all other conditions resulting in the board sending EOT ("$$$")
* Must use camel case on the OpenBCISimulator object.
* Renamed constructor options for readability:
  * `simulatorAlpha` to `simulatorInjectAlpha`
  * `simulatorLineNoise` to `simulatorInjectLineNoise`
* `connect()` no longer rejects on `close` or `error` event from the serialport.

# 0.3.9

### Enhancements

* Add tests for parsing raw packets

### Bug Fixes

* Removed `got here` log from `.streamStart()`
* Validate stop byte before emitting `rawDataPacket`

# 0.3.8

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed readme.md

# 0.3.7

### New Features

* Upgrade dependencies
* Update Travis

### Bug Fixes

* `.numberOfChannels()` now uses the info object, which is set in the constructor and on the return message from `.softReset()`
* `.sampleRate()` now uses the info object, which is set in the constructor and on the return message from `.softReset()`

# 0.3.6

### New Features

* Simulator now has accelerometer data

# 0.3.5

### New Features

* SD card support! Now logging to an SD card is easier than ever.

### Bug Fixes

* Sample rate does not return correct sample rate for custom rate on simulator. #58

# 0.3.4

### New Features

* Simulator made to look more like brainwave data to the user. Implemented a 1/f filter. Defaults to injecting 60Hz line noise with two channels of alpha (10Hz) boost.

### Github Issues Addressed

* [https://github.com/OpenBCI/openbci-js-sdk/issues/44](#44)

# 0.3.3

### Bug Fixes

* `rawDataPacket` not being emitted

# 0.3.2

### Work In Progress

* SNTP Time Synchronization

### Bug Fixes

* updates to README.me and comments to change ntp to sntp, because the two are similar, but not the same and we do not want to be misleading
* Extended [Stnp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sntp) to main openBCIBoard.js
* Add `.sntpNow()` function to get ntp time.

# 0.3.1

### Bug Fixes

* Bumped serialport version

# 0.3.0

### New Features

* Test Signals with ADS1299 using `.testSignal()`
* Continuous impedance testing, where each sample gets an `impedances` object that is an array of impedances for each
        channel.
* OpenBCI Radio Test File
* Added Sntp npm module with helper functions
* Removed stopByte and startByte from sampleObjects

### Breaking Changes

* Changed simulator name to `OpenBCISimulator`
* Changed name of function `simulatorOn` to `simulatorEnable`
* Changed name of function `simulatorOff` to `simulatorDisable`

### Work In Progress

* NTP Time Synchronization
* Goertzel algorithm to get voltage for impedance calculation

### Bug fixes

* Impedance calculations
* Readme updates
* Serial buffer had the chance to become permanently unaligned, optimized and completely transformed and refactored the way bytes are processed.
* Changes to gain of channels not working correctly.
* Node 5 compatibility

### Github Issues Addressed

* #25, #26, #27, #29, #30, #31, #33, #34
