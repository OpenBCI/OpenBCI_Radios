# OpenBCI_Radios

Libraries and firmware for OpenBCI Radio Modules.

## General Overview

The OpenBCI board has an on-board RFDuino radio module acting as a "Device". The OpenBCI system includes a USB dongle for the PC, which acts as the RFDuino "Host". The format of the OpenBCI data as seen on the PC is defined by a combination of the Arduino code on the OpenBCI board and of the RFDuino code running on the Host.

For a general discussion of the OpenBCI Radio firmware please refer to software section on the learning pages on [openbci.com](http://www.openbci.com).
