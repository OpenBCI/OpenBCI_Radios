* Name: OpenBCI_Radio_Definitions.h
* Date: 3/15/2016
* Purpose: This is the header file for the OpenBCI radios. Let us define two
*   over arching paradigms: Host and Device, where:
*     Host is connected to PC via USB VCP (FTDI).
*     Device is connectedd to uC (PIC32MX250F128B with UDB32-MX2-DIP).

* Author: Push The World LLC (AJ Keller)
*   Much credit must also go to Joel Murphy who with Conor Russomanno and Leif
*     Percifield created the original OpenBCI_32bit_Device.ino and
*     OpenBCI_32bit_Host.ino files in the Summer of 2014. Much of this code base
*     is inspired directly from their work.
