/*
* This sketch is OpenBCI_32bit specific and sets up a HOST module
* If you need to add custom files to your application software (sorry)
* If you want to modify this firmware, go to RFduino and download their latest release
* Install RFduino libraries as instructed from their website
* go here (there) to download the adjusted library components,
* and follow the instalation instructions to use the custom tools for OpenBCI
* 
* Since the Device must initiate communication, the
* device "polls" the Host evey 63mS when not sending packets.
* Host is connected to PC via USB VCP (FTDI).
* Device is connectedd to uC (PIC32MX250F128B with UDB32-MX2-DIP).
* 
* In streamingData mode, Host insterts a pre-fix and post-fix to the data for PC coordination.
* 
* Single byte serial messages sent from PC are modified by the Host to include a '+' before and after
* This is to avoid an error experienced when the uC gets a 'ghost' command byte during streamData mode
* 
* This software is provided as-is with no promise of workability
* Use at your own risk, wysiwyg.
